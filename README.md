## ðŸ“š Project Overview

**LoL Match Insights** is a data-driven project designed to collect, store, and analyze match data from Riot Games' official API.  
This project systematically **stores match data in a local SQLite database** for efficient querying and long-term analysis.  
Beyond simple win/loss outcomes, it aims to extract deep insights into player behaviors, objective control, and match dynamics.

Key analysis areas include:
- Match metadata analysis
- Time-based event tracking (objectives, pings, kills)
- Champion performance analysis
- Summoner playstyle analysis
- Data storage and management with SQLite
